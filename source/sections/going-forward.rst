Going Forward: Features to Look Forward To
==========================================

The following is a list of major features that are planned for version
1.0:

1. **Triggers.** Allow Gort to execute existing bundled commands `in
   response to non-command chat
   input <https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/117>`__. (Priority:
   very high)
2. **Dynamic command configuration.** Allow dynamic values like tokens
   and passwords to be `securely passed to commands at
   runtime <https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/114>`__. (Priority:
   very high)
3. **Custom webhooks.** Expose `custom (auth-gated) RESTful
   endpoints <https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/118>`__ that can be
   used to execute existing bundled commands. (Priority: high)
4. **Easing Rule and Permission Design**. Addition of a command-line
   `rule tester <https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/35>`__.
   (Priority: high)
5. **Two-factor authentication.** Add support for `two-factor
   authentication <https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/132>`__.
   (Priority: high)
6. **Dual authorization.** Add support for `dual (two-person)
   authorization <https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/131>`__.
   (Priority: high)
7. **Simplifying audit log access.** Create a ```gort logs``
   command <https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/156>`__. (Priority:
   medium-high)
8. **Internal key/value store.** Allow commands access to `an
   internally-scoped key/value
   store <https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/128>`__ to maintain
   state, a little like HTTP cookies. (Priority: medium)
9. **Support for other chat platforms.** `Microsoft
   Teams <https://github.com/getgort/gort/issues/121>`__ first, others
   TBD (Priority: medium-low)
